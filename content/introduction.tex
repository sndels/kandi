\section{Introduction}

Object tracking is a large and actively researched sub-area of computer vision. The
main task for a tracker is to find and follow the desired subject in a sequence of
images. Object tracking is closely related to other image analysis tasks so the
implementations also share elements. In the recent years, use of deep neural networks
has been researched for object tracking.

Many of the deep networks tailored to tracking tasks are variations of convolutional
networks. Another way used to extract features from a frame is a stacked denoising
autoencoder~\cite{LEARNING_DEEP}. The training of deep neural networks requires a
large amount of training data and their development has been made easier by an increase
in the size of applicaple datasets.\authorcomment{add cites to examples}

The goal of this thesis is to study the concepts behind object tracking and deep neural
networks. It will present the architectures and principles currently used in deep
neural networks tailored to object tracking tasks. The practices and datasets used
in training and evaluating such networks are also introduced.
