\section{Introduction}

Object tracking is a large and actively researched sub-area of computer vision. The
main task for a tracker is to find and follow the desired subject in a sequence of
images. Object tracking is closely related to other image analysis tasks so the
implementations also share elements. In the recent years, research has been made in
using deep neural networks for object tracking.

Many of the deep networks tailored to tracking tasks are variations of convolutional
networks\authorcomment{add cites to examples}. They consist of visible input and
output layers with several so-called hidden layers in between them. Another way of
extracting features from a frame is stacked denoising autoencoder~\cite{LEARNING_DEEP}.
The training of deep neural networks requires a large amount of training data and their
development has been made easier by an increase in the size of applicaple datasets.

The goal of this thesis is to study the concepts of object tracking and deep neural
networks. It will present the architectures and principles currently used in deep
neural networks tailored to object tracking tasks. The practices and datasets used
in training and evaluating such networks are also introduced.
