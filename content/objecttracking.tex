\section{Object tracking}
Object tracking in video sequences has been researched for decades and \ac{nn}-based
algorithms have recently been researched \authorcomment{cite works here} as \ac{nn}s'
capabilities in classification tasks have been noted \authorcomment{cite relevant works}.
There has also been development in the area of benchmarking the tracking algorithms
~\cite{OT_BENCH}.

\subsection{Overview}
Tracking methods can be roughly divided to generative and discriminative, but combinations
of them have also been proposed.\authorcomment{cite a combination}

Generative methods search the frame for the best matches to a template of an appearance
model of the subject. Template methods based on pixel intensity and color histograms
perform well with no drastic changes in object appearance and non-cluttered backgrounds.
Appearance models learnt from training can be less affected by appearance variations and
adaptive schemes provide added flexibility, while sparse models handle occlusion and
image noise better.~\cite{OBJECT_PLS}

Discriminative methods consider tracking as a binary classification problem. They take
the background also into account to separate the target from it. Used approaches
include refining the initial guess with a support vector machine~\cite{SVT} or utilizing
a relevance vector machine~\cite{SPARSE_BAYESIAN}.

\subsection{Deep neural networks in tracking}
(Overview of task from \ac{dnn}-point of view, strengths and weaknesses compared to
more traditional solutions.)

An early implementation of a \ac{cnn}-based tracker~\cite{HUMAN_CNN} pre-dates the work
of Krizhevsky et.~al.~\cite{NIPS_IMAGENET}. It takes modifies the architecture used for
detection to make the network less affected by sifts in the objects position in the
frame. Shift-invariancy is a non-desirable quality in tracking while using previous
positions as a as it might result to mixups with objects similar to the target.~\cite{HUMAN_CNN}

\subsection{Data sets and evaluation}
The datasets used for training are equally important as the actual network desing. %TODO: cite
Research on networks working with image data has been made easier by larger sets of both
hand-labeled sets and ones obtained by simple keyword searches from online image services.
These kinds of sets can be used to pre-train useful target features to tracking networks.
    There has also been an increase in resources devoted to tracking data with the
TR-100 -set~\cite{VTB} introduced in being a good example. It contains a hundred tracking
sequences with reference positions for the target on each frame. Because some of the
targets are similar or less challenging, a subset of 50 sequences considered challenging
is also provided as TR-50.~\cite{OT_BENCH}
