\section{Object tracking}
Object tracking in video sequences has been researched for decades using different
approaches for defining the target and adapting to changes in its shape or orientation.
The situations most likely to cause tracking failure have also been identified.

\subsection{Target representation}
Early influential works in the field have used target models including subspaces
~\cite{EIGENTRACK} and representing the target as a curve~\cite{CONDENSATION}. Modern
tracking methods can be roughly divided to generative and discriminative, but combinations
of them have also been proposed. \authorcomment{cite a combination}

Generative methods search the frame for the best matches to a template of an appearance
model of the subject. Template methods based on pixel intensity and color histograms
perform well with no drastic changes in object appearance and non-cluttered backgrounds.
Appearance models learned from training can be less affected by appearance variations
and adaptive schemes provide added flexibility, while sparse models handle occlusion
and image noise better.~\cite{OBJECT_PLS}

Discriminative methods consider tracking as a binary classification problem. They take
the background also into account to separate the target from it. Used approaches
include refining the initial guess with a support vector machine~\cite{SVT} or utilizing
a relevance vector machine~\cite{SPARSE_BAYESIAN}.

\subsection{Model update}
During tracking, the appearance of the target may change for example due to changes in
orientation. Some trackers adapt the tracking model online to be robust against such
changes, but care must be taken in designing the update algorithm as it could result
to drift.
