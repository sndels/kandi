\section{Object tracking}
Object tracking in video sequences has been researched for decades and the approaches
have included tracking based on subspaces~\cite{EIGENTRACK} and different kinds of
filtering~\cite{CONDENSATION}. Recently, the advancement in \ac{nn}'s capabilities in
object classification has resulted in much research on \ac{nn}s in object tracking
tasks.~\cite{OT_BENCH}

\subsection{Deep neural networks in tracking}
Overview of task from \ac{dnn}-point of view, strengths and weaknesses compared to
more traditional solutions.

\subsection{Data sets and evaluation}
Overview of the data sets used for training and analysis. Methods used for comparing
performance.
