\section{Data sets and evaluation}
\authorcomment{Overview of the data sets used for training and analysis. Methods
used for comparing performance.}

The datasets used for training are equally important as the actual network desing. %TODO: cite
Research on networks working with image data has been made easier by larger sets of both
hand-labeled sets and ones obtained by simple keyword searches from online image services.
These kinds of sets can be used to pre-train useful target features to tracking networks.

There has also been an increase in resources devoted to tracking data with the
TR-100 -set~\cite{VTB} introduced in being a good example. It contains a hundred tracking
sequences with reference positions for the target on each frame. Because some of the
targets are similar or less challenging, a subset of 50 sequences considered challenging
is also provided as TR-50.~\cite{OT_BENCH}
